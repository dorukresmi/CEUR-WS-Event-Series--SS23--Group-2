# Scrape and parse information about events and their series form dblp.org

### Overview

- `dblp.py` contains the logic for requesting pages and caching them.
- `DblpScraper.py` contains the logic for navigating dblp.org and requesting the correct pages.
- `DblpParser.py` is used to extract all meta informations from the requested html-files
- The parsed information is structured in dataclasses defined in the files `VenueInformationClasses.py`
  and `EventClasses.py`

### How dblp.org stores information

#### EventSeries

- The `name` is found in a `h1` tag inside the unique `header` tag with the `id=headline`
    - The abbreviation is within the name in parenthesis
- The venue information is given as `li` tags inside the unique div with the `id=info-section`
- The events are not in a particular structured form
    - They are `header` tags within the `div` with the `id=main`
    - Watch out to not include recursive search for finding `header'

#### Events

- The year, location, ordinal and title are all found in a `h2` tag
- The usual form is `[ordinal] title [year] [:location]`
    - However there are quite a lot of irregularities listed below
    - Sometimes one `h2` tag refers to multiple events seperated with `/`
        - `[ordinal] title (/ [ordinal title)* [year] [:location]`
        - However this is also [not consistent](https://dblp.org/db/conf/wlp/index.html)
